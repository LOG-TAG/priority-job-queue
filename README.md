###Android Priority Job Queue Example

This is just an example of using *Android Priority Job Queue* library shown during an Android Corner at Solid Gear.

In this app, you can see how to run jobs in parallel o create a serial execution, integrate with other Schedulers... Also, you are free to create new jobs or test other configuration to understand better the usage of the library.

> *Note*
 Sorry for the UI, it is just an example.
